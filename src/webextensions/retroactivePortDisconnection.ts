/**
 * Handle asynchronously-registered Port disconnection events.

 * This enables two features that Ports don't support directly:
 *
 * - asking a Port if it's already disconnected
 * - registering a disconnect handler after disconnection has happened, and
 *   having it still fire.
 *
 * In contrast, regular Port.onDisconnect listeners must be registered
 * synchronously as soon as a port is created/received. This is problematic if
 * the setup process for a Port connection is asynchronous â€” disconnect
 * listeners may not fire if they're registered after a delay, and this can
 * result in non-deterministic behaviour.
