/**
 * Create a Port connected to Vaultonomy's dev-mode extension from a web page.
 *
 * This is used by the dev-mode Vaultonomy UI (served from the dev-server via
 * HTTP) to connect to the Vaultonomy extension, itself running in unpacked dev
 * mode
 *
 * By default, web pages can't connect to extensions, so this requires a few
 * things to work:
 *
 * 1. The web page calling this must be served from http://vaultonomy.localhost:5173
 *    The Vaultonomy manifest.json (in dev-mode only) lists this origin as
 *    externally_connectable, which gives it permission it to connect.
 * 2. The dynamic dev-mode extension ID. Unlike the published extension, the
 *    unpacked extension has a different ID for each install, so it must be
 *    configured. See the definition of VAULTONOMY_DEV_EXTENSION_ID.
 *
 * The connections created here fire the chrome.runtime.onConnectExternal event,
 * not the regular chrome.runtime.onConnect event.
