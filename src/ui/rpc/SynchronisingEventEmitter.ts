// I'm not super-happy with this. The differences between running the dev-mode
// UI in a regular web page and the real UI in the extension mean that we can't
// use the same notification method for both. The simplest thing would be to use
// browser.runtime.sendMessage from the backend to notify the extension UI, and
// use the RPC notifications for the dev-mode UI (which can't receive extension
// messages as it's outside the extension). I'm favouring using the same
// mechanism for both, even though it makes the extension itself a little more
// complicated than it could be â€” I'd rather maintain one slightly more
// complicated thing than two separate notification mechanisms.
