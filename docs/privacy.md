# Vaultonomy Privacy Policy

## Reddit Requests

Vaultonomy's main functionality works by making web requests to Reddit using the
Reddit account you're logged in with. These requests are made directly to Reddit
from your web browser, nobody other than Reddit has any access to your activity.
No credentials ever leave your browser. For example, when you search for a user
with Vaultonomy, Vaultonomy makes a web request to Reddit from your browser,
using your Reddit account's credentials, to search for the username. So Reddit
can see that you searched for the username. This is the same as if you were
using the Reddit website directly.

## Anonymous Statistics

Vaultonomy does not track individual user behaviour, but does collect anonymous
high-level events in order to build aggregated metrics across its whole user
base. For example, the number of Vaults paired, or number of searches performed,
but **not** who or which Vault was paired, and **not** what was searched for.

Vaultonomy does not store any persistent cookie or identifier. When Vaultonomy
sends anonymous event data, it uses the Anonystat anonymising proxy to also hide
your computer's network address and browser details, so neither the event data
itself or the network request contains any private or identifiable information.
Anonystat is deployed globally, so that network requests to it are handled
within your geographic region. For more details on Anonystat, see
https://github.com/h4l/anonystat.
