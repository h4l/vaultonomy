# Vaultonomy

A browser extension for [Reddit Vaults]. Vaultonomy can:

- Pair regular Web3 Wallets as your Reddit account's Vault
- Show your current and past Vaults
- Show the Vault of other Reddit users

Without Vaultonomy, the only way to create a Reddit Vault was to put your seed
phrase into Reddit's mobile app. With Vaultonomy, you can set your Reddit
account's Vault to be your regular Web3 Wallet. This includes hardware wallets —
you can hold your Reddit Avatars and community tokens securely on a hardware
wallet while using them on Reddit.
