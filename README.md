Without Vaultonomy, the only way to create a Reddit Vault was to put your seed
phrase into Reddit's mobile app. With Vaultonomy, you can set your Reddit
account's Vault to be your regular Web3 Wallet. This includes hardware wallets —
you can hold your Reddit Avatars and community tokens securely on a hardware
wallet while using them on Reddit.

## Install

**Vaultonomy undergoing pre-release testing.** It will be available from the
Chrome Web Store and Firefox Add-Ons in a few weeks.

> We'll be running a pre-release beta test before public release, if you'd like
> to participate in pre-release testing, DM
> [/u/h4l on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/u/h4l). You'll need a desktop Chrome
> browser (including Chrome-based, like Brave, Edge) or Firefox.
